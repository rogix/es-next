# Array Includes()

> The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.

## indexOf()

Let's say we have the following array:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

How to check if the value 3 is included in the array?

Before the `includes()` method was introduced, we could use the `indexOf()` method:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

array.indexOf(3); // 2

arra.indexOf(6); // -1
```

The `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the array, or -1 if the value is not present.

:::note
In the above example, `array.indexOf(3)` returns 2 because in Javascprit, as in many other programming languages, arrays are _**zero-base indexing**_.
What it means is that the first element in the array is at index 0, the second at index 1, the third at index 2 and so on.
:::

This way if we want to check if the value 3 is included in the array, we can use the following code:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

if (array.indexOf(3) !== -1) {
  console.log("The value 3 is included in the array");
}
```

But, `indexOf()` is not the best way to check this:

1. The name of the method is not clear.
2. It doesn't work with `NaN` values, because `indexOf()` use the `strict equality (===)` to compare the elements.

So, for example:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, NaN];

array.indexOf(NaN); // -1
```

It return -1 because `NaN` is not equal to `NaN`.

## includes()

To fix this, we can use the `includes()` method:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

array.includes(3); // true

array.includes(6); // false
```

:::info
The `includes()` method uses the `sameValueZero` algorithm to compare values.
